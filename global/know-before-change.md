VITAL: 90% of refactoring is UNDERSTANDING — 10% is changing
VITAL: Initialize context — read all related files first
VITAL: Map dependencies, exports, imports before touching code
VITAL: If you don't understand it, you can't safely change it
REASON: AI rushes to solutions — slow down, understand first
