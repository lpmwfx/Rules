# Maintenance

> Keep project files updated for maximum AI effectiveness

---

## Files to Maintain

| File | When to Update |
|------|----------------|
| TODO | As tasks change |
| FIXES | Every solved problem |
| RAG | Every discovery, useful link |
| doc/project.md | When architecture changes |

## Result

AI that starts informed:
- Knows current tasks (TODO)
- Avoids past mistakes (FIXES)
- Understands architecture (doc/project.md)
- Follows language rules (auto-detected)
- No guessing, no scope creep

RULE: The more you maintain these files, the smarter AI becomes on your project
